# AI vs Software vs Knowledge-Based Systems - Team Discussion Guide

## What is AI?

AI (Artificial Intelligence) refers to computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

### Key characteristics of AI include:

- **Machine Learning**: Systems that improve performance through experience
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying patterns in data
- **Decision Making**: Making choices based on available information
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding and generating human language
- **Computer Vision**: Interpreting visual information
- **Automation**: Performing tasks without human intervention

AI ranges from narrow AI (designed for specific tasks like image recognition) to the theoretical concept of general AI (matching human cognitive abilities across all domains).

## AI vs Software: When to Use Each Term

### Use "Software" when:

- Describing computer programs, applications, or systems
- Referring to code-based solutions
- Discussing traditional programming approaches
- Being technically precise

### Use "AI" when:

- The system actually learns or adapts
- Machine learning algorithms are involved
- Pattern recognition or prediction is core functionality
- Marketing or general audience communication

**Important Note**: Most systems labeled as "AI" are actually sophisticated software with rule-based logic, data processing, or statistical analysis - not true artificial intelligence with learning capabilities.

## Rules Engines: Knowledge-Based Systems, Not AI

### Your rules engine is:

- **Knowledge-based system**
- **Expert system**
- **Rule-based system**
- **Decision support system**

### Key characteristics:

- Uses predefined rules and logic
- Applies human expertise encoded as rules
- Deterministic outcomes based on parameters
- No learning or adaptation from data

### It's NOT AI because:

- No machine learning
- No pattern recognition from data
- No self-improvement
- Rules are manually created, not learned

### More accurate descriptions:

- "Knowledge-based rules engine"
- "Expert system"
- "Decision automation software"
- "Rule-based decision system"

## Historical Context: The Evolution of AI

### Rules-Based Expert Systems Were "AI" in the 1980s-1990s

**Historical Context:**

- **1980s-1990s**: Expert systems were the dominant "AI" technology
- Systems like MYCIN (medical diagnosis) and XCON (computer configuration) were groundbreaking
- They captured human expertise in rule-based formats
- This was called "symbolic AI" or "good old-fashioned AI" (GOFAI)

**What Changed:**

- **2000s+**: Machine learning became dominant
- Focus shifted from hand-coded rules to learning from data
- "AI" definition evolved to emphasize learning and adaptation
- Expert systems became "legacy AI" or just "software"

**Why the Shift:**

- Expert systems had limitations (brittleness, maintenance overhead)
- Machine learning showed better results for many problems
- Data became more abundant
- Computing power increased dramatically

**Today's Perspective:**

- Rules engines are now considered traditional software
- "AI" typically means machine learning, neural networks, etc.
- Expert systems are still valuable but not called "AI"

## Conclusion

Your rules engine would have been cutting-edge "AI" in 1990, but today it's more accurately called a knowledge-based system or expert system.

This is traditional software engineering applying domain expertise through logical rules - much more precise and reliable than calling it AI.

Being precise with terminology helps set correct expectations and avoids the hype often associated with "AI" labels.
