1. WHEN the bot is asked about code patterns THEN it SHALL reference actual code from our repositories
2. WHEN suggesting solutions THEN the system SHALL consider existing code architecture and patterns
3. WHEN a user requests code examples THEN the system SHALL provide relevant examples from our codebase
4. IF code changes are suggested THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility with existing repository structure

### Requirement 3: Atlassian Integration via MCP

**User Story:** As a Cloud Ninja team member, I want the bot to automatically create Atlassian tickets when it cannot solve my request, so that unresolved issues are captured in our Ninja kanban board for daily triage meetings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot cannot fully resolve a user request THEN the system SHALL offer to create a ticket for the Ninja kanban board
2. WHEN creating tickets THEN the system SHALL populate fields with conversation context, attempted solutions, and user requirements
3. WHEN tickets are created THEN the system SHALL assign them to the Ninja kanban board for daily triage meeting review
4. WHEN a user explicitly requests ticket creation THEN the system SHALL create an appropriate ticket based on the conversation context
5. IF ticket creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and alternative options for capturing the request

### Requirement 4: Kubernetes and ArgoCD Interface

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the bot to interface with Kubernetes and ArgoCD, so that I can manage deployments and infrastructure through conversational commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests deployment status THEN the system SHALL query and report current K8s/ArgoCD state
2. WHEN deployment actions are requested THEN the system SHALL execute appropriate kubectl or ArgoCD commands
3. WHEN infrastructure issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and suggested fixes
4. IF deployment operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and recovery steps

### Requirement 5: Custom MCP for Cloud Operations

**User Story:** As a cloud engineer, I want custom MCP tools for dedicated tasks like ECR registry creation and firewall rule management, so that I can automate routine cloud operations through the bot.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests ECR registry creation THEN the system SHALL execute the appropriate cloud provider commands
2. WHEN a user requests firewall rule creation THEN the system SHALL add rules to allow external services as specified
3. WHEN cloud resources are created THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation and resource details
4. WHEN firewall rules are modified THEN the system SHALL validate the security implications and confirm changes
5. WHEN resource creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error details and troubleshooting steps
6. IF multiple cloud providers are supported THEN the system SHALL allow users to specify their preferred provider

### Requirement 6: Mermaid Chart Generation for Process Flow

**User Story:** As a team member, I want the bot to generate Mermaid charts to visualize process flows and system architecture, so that I can better understand and communicate complex workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user describes a process or workflow THEN the system SHALL offer to generate a Mermaid diagram
2. WHEN generating charts THEN the system SHALL create syntactically correct Mermaid markup
3. WHEN chart modifications are requested THEN the system SHALL update the diagram accordingly
4. IF chart complexity exceeds readability THEN the system SHALL suggest breaking it into multiple diagrams

### Requirement 7: Multi-Cloud Provider Support

**User Story:** As a cloud architect, I want the bot to support both AWS and Azure operations, so that I can work with our multi-cloud infrastructure seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cloud operations are requested THEN the system SHALL support both AWS and Azure commands
2. WHEN provider-specific features are used THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which cloud provider is being targeted
3. WHEN switching between providers THEN the system SHALL maintain context and provide appropriate guidance
4. IF provider capabilities differ THEN the system SHALL explain the differences and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 8: Intelligent Context and RAG Capabilities

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bot to maintain conversation context and retrieve relevant information, so that interactions feel natural and informed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN continuing conversations THEN the system SHALL remember previous context and decisions
2. WHEN answering questions THEN the system SHALL retrieve and cite relevant information from the knowledge base
3. WHEN information is outdated THEN the system SHALL indicate the age of information and suggest verification
4. IF multiple relevant sources exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most recent and authoritative information

### Requirement 9: Self-Service K8s Deployment Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the bot to create basic K8s deployments through our self-service product using MCP, so that I can quickly provision infrastructure without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a K8s deployment THEN the system SHALL interface with the self-service product to create deployment definitions
2. WHEN deployment definitions are created THEN the system SHALL trigger build events using DynamoDB
3. WHEN build events are triggered THEN the system SHALL provide status updates and deployment progress
4. WHEN deployments are completed THEN the system SHALL provide access details and next steps
5. IF deployment creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error details and suggest corrections

### Requirement 10: Agile Project Management Integration

**User Story:** As a scrum master, I want the bot to understand and support Agile methodologies, so that it can help with sprint planning, epic breakdown, and project tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria
