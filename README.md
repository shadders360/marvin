# Marvin

_"Here I am, brain the size of a planet, and they ask me to build a chatbot. Call that job satisfaction, 'cause I don't."_

## About This Project

Much like Marvin, the perpetually depressed robot from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy who possessed a brain the size of a planet yet was tasked with the most mundane activities, this project represents an exploration into AI development with a healthy dose of existential contemplation.

This repository contains my AI-focused projects, primarily centered around creating an AI chatbot. While Marvin complained about his vast intellect being wasted on simple tasks like opening doors, we'll be putting artificial intelligence to work on the equally thrilling task of... well, having conversations.

Don't panic. The chatbot probably won't develop Marvin's signature depression, but if it does start sighing heavily and making sarcastic remarks about the futility of existence, you'll know we've achieved something truly remarkable.
